My name's Tyler <html>&#128075;</html>

I'm currently on the job market, looking for a remote position in the realm of data/analytics engineering or data science. 

Most recently, I worked as a data scientist, product manager, and engineer at [Cerebral](https://cerebral.com). In these positions, I both managed and implemented Cerebral's data products arm, which included projects such as [an embedded Clinicial Decision Support tool](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/embattled-startup-cerebral-tripling-down-clinical-quality-efforts-ceo-says-amid-0#:~:text=The%20company%20built%20a%20clinical%20decision%20support%20tool%20to%20encourage%20clinicians%20to%20follow%20evidence%2Dbased%20decisions%20and%20provide%20clinical%20guidelines%20for%20prescribing%20patterns%2C%20Mou%C2%A0said.) to provide clinical guidence to clinicians as well as [an NLP model trained to detect mental crisis messages](https://cerebral.com/blog/how-cerebral-is-improving-response-times-to-help-patients-in-crisis) from patients coming in via the support chat (which led to average response times of less than 10 minutes rather than over 12 hours for the normal support messages). Additionally, I created and led the data quality initiatives for the team, including a twice-quarterly day-long hackathon to address gaps in infrastructure and best practices across the data ecosystem.

Before that, I worked as a data scientist and software developer at [Epic Systems](https://epic.com), focusing on predictive models for clinical and operational usage in Epic's EMR as well as [epidemiological](https://epicresearch.org/articles/sepsis-and-mortality-rates-are-higher-in-patients-hospitalized-for-covid-19-than-for-influenza) and [utilization research](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/how-were-hospital-admissions-impacted-by-covid-19-trends-in-overall-and-non-covid-19-hospital-admissions-through-august-8-2020/) into COVID-19 patient populations to [inform health system behavior](https://epicresearch.org/articles/cancer-screenings-are-still-lagging). 

I did my Ph.D. at [Princeton's Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics](https://lsi.princeton.edu/) in [Mike Levine's lab](https://mikelevinelab.com/), working on developmental biology questions largely using microscopy and transcriptomic data. 

While my previous background resolves largely around healthcare and microscopy data, I am always interested in gaining expertise in new domains. I have a passion for data quality, reproducible research, scientific communication, and novelly applying machine learning tools to real-world problems.
