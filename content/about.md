My name's Tyler

I'm currently working as a data scientist at Epic Systems, focusing on predictive models centered around healthcare use cases. 

Previously, I did my Ph.D. at Princeton in Mike Levine's lab, working on developmental biology questions largely using microscopy and transcriptomic data.
