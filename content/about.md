My name's Tyler

I'm currently working as a data scientist at Epic Systems, focusing on predictive models centered around healthcare use cases. 

Previously, I did my Ph.D. at Princeton in Mike Levine's lab, working on developmental biology questions largely using microscopy and transcriptomic data. 

While my previous background resolves largely around healthcare and microscopy data, I am always interested in gaining expertise in new domains. I have a passion for reproducible research, scientific communication, and novelly applying machine learning tools to real-world problems.
