My name's Tyler <html>&#128075;</html>

I'm currently working as a Principal Analytics Engineer at [Hubspot](https://hubspot.com), 
focusing on corporate reporting related to the comapany's financial data.

Most recently, I worked as a senior data engineer at [Joyn Insurance](https://joyninsurance.com), 
where I was the one of two members of the data organization. 
While there, I completely re-designed and modernized Joyn's data ecosystem and platform.
Further, I automated away dozens of human-hours weekly and better ensured compliance 
by implementing several reverse ELT processes from Joyn's data warehouse to clients, vendors, and regulatory reporting agencies. 
I also increased the maturity of Joyn's software development processes, 
introducing better CI/CD practices, documentation, and testing across the organization. 

In 2021, I started working as a data scientist, data product manager, and data engineer at [Cerebral](https://cerebral.com). 
In these positions, I both managed and implemented Cerebral's data products arm, 
which included projects such as [an embedded Clinicial Decision Support tool](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/embattled-startup-cerebral-tripling-down-clinical-quality-efforts-ceo-says-amid-0#:~:text=The%20company%20built%20a%20clinical%20decision%20support%20tool%20to%20encourage%20clinicians%20to%20follow%20evidence%2Dbased%20decisions%20and%20provide%20clinical%20guidelines%20for%20prescribing%20patterns%2C%20Mou%C2%A0said.) to provide clinical guidence to clinicians as well as [an NLP model trained to detect mental crisis messages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-023-00951-3) from patients coming in via the support chat (which led to average response times of less than 10 minutes rather than over 12 hours for the normal support messages). Additionally, I created and led the data quality initiatives for the team, including a twice-quarterly day-long hackathon to address gaps in infrastructure and best practices across the data ecosystem.

Before that, I worked as a data scientist and software developer at [Epic Systems](https://epic.com), 
focusing on predictive models for clinical and operational usage in Epic's EMR as well as [epidemiological](https://epicresearch.org/articles/sepsis-and-mortality-rates-are-higher-in-patients-hospitalized-for-covid-19-than-for-influenza) 
and [utilization research](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/how-were-hospital-admissions-impacted-by-covid-19-trends-in-overall-and-non-covid-19-hospital-admissions-through-august-8-2020/) 
into COVID-19 patient populations to [inform health system behavior](https://epicresearch.org/articles/cancer-screenings-are-still-lagging). 

I did my Ph.D. at [Princeton's Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics](https://lsi.princeton.edu/) 
in [Mike Levine's lab](https://mikelevinelab.com/), working on developmental biology questions largely using microscopy and transcriptomic data. 

While my previous background resolves largely around healthcare and microscopy data, 
I am always interested in gaining expertise in new domains. 
I have a passion for enabling data-driven decision-making, data quality, reproducible research, and scientific communication.
